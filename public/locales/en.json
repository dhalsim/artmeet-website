    "text": "ArtMeet is a meeting point between art, ecology, and urban culture. In each edition, it asks current social questions, seeks new relationships and possibilities. It brings together artists, researchers, and communities to open spaces for collective production and thinking. Between the traces of the past and the crises of today, it invites to imagine a new future through art. ArtMeet seeks ways to breathe in the city and live together."
